  <h3>Who am I? </h3>
  <p>
    I was born in a small village in Vietnam north of Tuy Hoa City. I moved to the Orange County in 2005 when I was 7. Even as a kid in a rural area, I knew my destiny lies somewhere in
    technology. I remember the first video tape player I took apart; I was so fascinated by, what I now know to be capacitor, colorful cylinders inside and by how it works. I would go around taking
    apart any old electronic I could. Video games and personal computers started to appear in my village and I would be glue to these contraptions. Looking back, it's pretty cool to know
    that STEM was always going to be the career path I would choose.
  </p>
  <h3> Professionally?</h3>
  <p>
    This is where I start boasting! They say that action speaks louder than words and you'll see that when you get to my Projects Tab, but for now I want to paint you a picture of a hard worker.
    I've had three significant jobs in my life. First, making and selling funnel cakes out of a food truck. Second, a STEAM mentor for a Lab mentoring students after school. Third, a student consultant
    for UCI's Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation. In every single one of these jobs, I took pride in knowing that I do good work, I have a good rapport and working relationship with coworkers
    and immediate mananger. Working with food made me realize the importance of taking innitiative. My boss was a self starter and he would hustle to take on any jobs and catering event he could find. That's
    how we got to catered for the premier of Spider-Man: Homecoming at the Pantageous Theater. It also taught me to slow down, the customer is king, but I can't serve the customer correctly if I am not performing
    at max capacity by rushing order and taking short cuts.
